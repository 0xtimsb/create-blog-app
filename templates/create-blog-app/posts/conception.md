**Stephen Hillenburg** first became fascinated with the ocean as a child. He began developing his artistic abilities at a young age. During college, he studied marine biology and minored in art. He planned to return to graduate school and eventually to pursue a master's degree in art. After graduating in 1984 from Humboldt State University, he joined the **Ocean Institute**, an organization in **Dana Point, California**, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. While he was there, he had the initial idea that would lead to the creation of SpongeBob SquarePantsâ€”a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone.

The host of the comic was **"Bob the Sponge"** who, unlike **SpongeBob**, resembled an actual sea sponge. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue an animation career.
