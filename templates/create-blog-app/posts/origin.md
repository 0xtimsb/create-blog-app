SpongeBob was created and designed by **Stephen Hillenburg**, an artist and marine science educator. The character's name is derived from **"Bob the Sponge"**, the host of Hillenburg's comic book The Intertidal Zone. He drew the book while teaching marine biology to visitors of the Ocean Institute during the 1980s. Hillenburg began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the 1996 cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, which Hillenburg directed. SpongeBob's first appearance was in the pilot, **"Help Wanted"**, which premiered on May 1, 1999.
